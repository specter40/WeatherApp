## Part 1: App Description

> Please provide a firendly description of your app, including the
> the primary functions available to users of the app. Be sure to
> describe exactly what APIs you are using and how they are connected
> in a meaningful way.

> **Also, include the GitHub `https` URL to your repository.**

The app that I created asks for the user to input any city into the search box.
    Once they input their city of choice, they can press the "Get City"
    button so that the app displays the city location information.
    After that, the user can press the "Get Weather" button to get
    the current weather for that city.

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

I learned how to use my own GitHub account and create a new private
    repository.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

I would try to read more about my APIs first before I work on
    the project because there were instances where I had
    to scrap some ideas because the APIs did not work with my app.
    For example, I really wanted to use an API to output video. However,
    sound doesn't work on the app, and I spent so much time trying to
    get the idea to work.
